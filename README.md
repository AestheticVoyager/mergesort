## Goal

Our goal is to compare the length and "complexity" of the same code in many different languages. Which language is the best? Now we can know.

Functional languages like Scala and Haskell seem to make much smaller code than, Dart.

## Getting started

Don't know [merge sort algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merge_sort).<br>
Pick up a [programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_programming_languages) and try to implement it yourself
 
## Running all of the versions
 
 Install everything you need and run: `./run.sh`

## Pull Requests

 Make sure you have your language running in CI and it uses the list [5,9,1,3,4,6,6,3,2]
